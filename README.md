###### This is a friend pairing social media app. The general concept is that many people tend to socialize with no more than 5 of their closest friends. In order to break free of that habit, this app will randomly generate "pairings" of your facebook friends for you to socialize and hangout with.

###### TODO

1) Facebook authentication

2) Adding registered users to database

3) Getting location from every request (coordinated)

4) Users create events on friend search radius, number of friends, list of friends

5) Search algorithm for "random" meets

6) Blocking friends

7) Chat interface

8) Map interface

** Move to mobile develoment
